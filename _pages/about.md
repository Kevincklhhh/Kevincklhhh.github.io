<p>I am Kailai Cui, a 3rd year PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor Kang G. Shin and Professor Ke Sun.</p>

<p>My research interests lie in mobile and wearable systems, with a focus on multimodal AI. Currently, I am investigating multimodal AI frameworks for human memory augmentation, focusing on extracting structured context and persistent object states from daily interactions captured through smart glasses. This work involves developing novel video analysis frameworks that orchestrate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and SAM2 to track non-rigid object transformations across long egocentric videos.</p>

<p>Previously, I designed novel sensing systems for UWB-based smartphone localization inside vehicles to prevent distracted driving. I also worked on IoT security through power side-channel auditing. I completed my undergraduate studies at the College of William & Mary, where I earned Bachelor of Science degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics, working under the supervision of Professor Gang Zhou.</p>
