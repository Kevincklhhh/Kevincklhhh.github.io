<p>Hi! My name is Kailai Cui. I am a senior at College of William and Mary. I am now looking for a CS PhD program.</p>

<p>My reserch interest inclues **Internet of Things**, **Applied Machine Learning**, **Sensor Networks**. I am very passionate about research. I have always been motivated to apply computing power and/or AI on physical objects to benefit individuals and society. In particular, the idea that objects become smart and connected fascinates me.</p>

<p>At William and Mary, I am fortunate enough to work under the supervision of Dr. **Gang Zhou**. A major project I did is called LightAuditor, in which we tackled IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing. Now, I am working on an honor thesis that aims to infer user's activity of a smart IoT device based on the power consumption. Another projet is to deploy the security system in the earlier project to real IoT devices. Implementing deep learning on edge devices requires consideration about computing resource and the security issue in communication with the cloud. I am working with PhD candidate Woosub Jung and Dr. Zhou on the project.</p>
