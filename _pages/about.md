<p>I am Kailai Cui, a 3rd year PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor Kang G. Shin and Professor Ke Sun.</p>

<p>My research interests lie in mobile and wearable systems, with a focus on foundation models for mobile systems. Currently, I am investigating VLM frameworks for human memory augmentation, focusing on extracting structured context and persistent object states from daily interactions. I developed an egocentric perception system that augments human memory by automatically tracking the semantic state evolution of household food, and created the first Food State Benchmark on egocentric video datasets. I also design novel sensing systems for UWB localization and IoT security.</p>

<p>Previously, I developed a system for UWB-based smartphone localization inside vehicles to prevent distracted driving, and worked on IoT security through power side-channel auditing. I completed my undergraduate studies at the College of William & Mary, where I earned Bachelor of Science degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics, working under the supervision of Professor Gang Zhou.</p>
