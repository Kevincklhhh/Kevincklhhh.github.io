<p>Hi! My name is Kailai Cui. I am a senior at College of William and Mary. I am now looking for a CS PhD program.</p>

<p>My reserch interest inclues embedded and mobile systems,  Internet of Things, Applied Machine Learning. I am eager to design efficient systems that synthesize inputs and make reliable decisions.</p>

<p>At William and Mary, I am fortunate enough to work under the supervision of Dr. Gang Zhou. A major project I did is called LightAuditor, in which we tackled IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing. Now, I am working on an honor thesis that aims to infer user's activity of a smart IoT device based on the power consumption. Another projet is to deploy the security system in the earlier project to real IoT devices. </p>
