<p>Hi! My name is Kailai Cui. I am a senior at College of William and Mary. I am now looking for a CS PhD program.</p>

<p>My reserch interests include embedded and mobile systems, Internet of Things security and applied machine learning. I am eager to design systems that synthesize inputs and make reliable decisions. I am also interested in making such systems secure, efficient and reliable. </p>

<p>At William and Mary, I am fortunate enough to work under the supervision of [Dr. Gang Zhou](https://gzhou.pages.wm.edu/). A major project I participated in is called LightAuditor, in which we tackled IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing. Now, I am working on my honor thesis project which aims to infer user's activity of a smart IoT device based on the power consumption. Another project is to deploy the security system in the earlier project to real IoT devices. </p>
