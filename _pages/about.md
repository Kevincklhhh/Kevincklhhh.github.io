<p>I am Kailai Cui. I am a first year PhD student in CSE at the University of Michigan. My advisor is Professor Kang Shin.</p>

<p>My research interests include mobile computing systems, and the security of such systems. I am currently working on a novel battery-enabled anti-theft vehicle immobilizer, collaborating with Professor Liang He from the University of Colorado, Denver. </p>

<p>I finished my undergraduate studies at William & Mary, where I worked under the supervision of Dr. Gang Zhou. A major project I participated in is Light Auditor, in which we tackled IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing. Now, I am working on my honor thesis project which aims to infer user's activity of a smart IoT device based on the power consumption. Another project is to deploy the security system in the earlier project to real IoT devices. </p>

<p>Besides computer science, I was also a student of mathematics. I worked on computational group theory with Dr. Eric Swartz. I read about algorithms that search for permutation group elements by observing their actions on different graphs. The math classes I took, including analysis, algebra and topology have trained me to think rigorously and understand abstract concepts.  </p>
