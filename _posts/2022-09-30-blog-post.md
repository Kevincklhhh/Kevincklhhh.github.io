On September 30th, the 2022 Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium took place in Swem Library Read & Relay Room. There were more than 50 impressive undergraduate research posters presented by W&M undergraduates. Among them, Kailai Cui, who received the 2022 Charles Center summer research grant, showcased our recent research project called "Light Auditor". In this work, we are tackling IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing. I am pleased that I was able to support his research and the poster presentation. This work will also appear in SenSys'22 later this year in Boston.
