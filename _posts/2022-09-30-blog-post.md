On September 30th, the 2022 Fall Undergraduate Research Symposium took place in Swem Library Read & Relay Room. Among more than 50 research posters presented by W&M undergraduates, I showcased our recent research project called "Light Auditor". In this work, we are tackling IoT privacy via power side-channel auditing.	A novel covert channel attack leaks user’s private data by encoding and transmitting them through smart bulb’s infrared emission. We used a power-auditing system and a CNN model that identifies the smart bulb’s leaking of private data. For the symposium, I prepared a jargon-free presentation of the work. While the audiences may not know what is a security model, they understand that smart bulb can encode data and send them through infrared emission. I was happy that non-CS people could appreciate the value of our work. This work will also appear in SenSys'22 later this year in Boston.
