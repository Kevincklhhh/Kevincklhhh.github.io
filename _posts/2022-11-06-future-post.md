From Nov 6 to 9th, I traveled to Boston to attend ACM SenSys where I shared my work with researchers and learned about the diverse research that others did. Some professors asked insightful questions about my project, for example, is an analytical model more suitable for the task? What knowledge does the machine learning model produce? From such conversations, I learned to place my research in the context of a broader applications and question its scientific value. 
I also worked as a student volunteer. This gives me the chance to talk to many students and know about their PhD life.
